**LOCATE ME**

This is an android application which I developed for fun. All that it does as of now is to just get your current GNS Lattitude and Longitude and text them as an SMS to the hardcored cell phone number.

**TO DO**

*There is a lot to be done! Atleast set a textEdit to input the mobile number!*
